Improve the product catalog to allow users do the following:

    - The products are stored with objects literals inside the arrays
    - Instead of using the prompt, you will allow them input the product info directly from the browser (hint: use querySelector and form event listener)

    - Show all the products they entered in the browser (hint: use a for..of loop)
